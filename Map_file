The map file should follow the following format and must have a header line.
This file should correspond to the genotype file. For example, if each animal has ten genotypes then the map file should have eleven lines (header included).
Example of an acceptable map file by the program:
snp_name chr location
SNP_1 1 7762
SNP_2 1 9078
SNP_3 1 10325
SNP_4 1 11103
SNP_5 2 1150
SNP_6 2 1167
SNP_7 2 1204
SNP_8 3 15665
SNP_9 3 16049
SNP_10 3 16506
